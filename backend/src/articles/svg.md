## What is SVG?

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a type of image file format used for vector graphics on the web. Unlike raster graphics which are made up of pixels, vector graphics are made up of paths, shapes, and curves defined by mathematical equations.

This allows SVGs to be resized without losing quality, making them well-suited for graphics that need to be resized often, such as logos, icons, and illustrations. SVGs can be created and edited using vector graphic design software, and can be animated using CSS or JavaScript. They are widely supported across web browsers and devices.

## When to use SVG?

It makes sense to use SVG when:

Resolution independence is required: Since SVGs are vector-based, they can be scaled up or down without losing quality, making them ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations that need to be resized often.

High-quality graphics are desired: SVGs can produce sharp, clean graphics with small file sizes, making them a good choice for graphics that need to be detailed and high-quality.

Animations are needed: SVGs can be animated using CSS or JavaScript, making them a good choice for interactive graphics, charts, and other data visualizations.

Accessibility is important: SVGs can be made accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, making them a good choice for graphics that need to be inclusive and accessible to all users.

Web performance is a concern: Since SVGs have small file sizes, they can be loaded quickly, improving the overall performance of a web page.

It's important to note that while SVGs are well-suited for certain types of graphics, they may not be the best choice for all graphics. For example, photographs and complex images with many colors and shades are better suited to raster formats like JPEG or PNG.
