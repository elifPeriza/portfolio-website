For a recent project I used the react markdown library. However, I found the documentation not to be very beginner-friendly. So here's a guide how to use it with nextjs.

## What for?

React Markdown is a library used for rendering markdown text into HTML elements in React applications. Markdown is a simple syntax for formatting plain text documents, and it is commonly used for writing content for websites, blogs, and other applications.

React Markdown allows developers to write their content in Markdown syntax and then render it as HTML elements within a React application. This makes it easy to create dynamic, reusable, and scalable components for displaying content in a user-friendly format.

## How does it work?

React Markdown works by converting the markdown text into a tree-like structure of React components, which can then be rendered into the DOM. This structure can be easily customized and styled using React's built-in styling capabilities or CSS.
