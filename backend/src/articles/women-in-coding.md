Women have made and continue to make significant contributions to the field of computer programming and technology. Ada Lovelace is one of the most popular. It is worth diving deeper into how the role of women changed over time.

## Early computers: The 1940s and 1950s

During the early days of computing in the 1940s and 1950s, women played a significant role as "computers" or human calculators. During World War II, many women were employed by the US government to work on mathematical calculations for the military. These women, who were called "computers," performed calculations using mechanical calculators and were responsible for performing a variety of mathematical and scientific calculations.

After the war, the use of electronic computers began to increase, and women continued to play an important role as "computers." They were employed by government agencies and private companies to perform calculations for scientific and engineering projects. These women worked with early computers like the ENIAC, UNIVAC, and IBM 704.

Despite their important contributions, the role of women as "computers" was often undervalued, and they were paid less than their male counterparts. However, their work laid the foundation for the development of software and paved the way for women to play a more significant role in the programming field in the future.

## Emergence of Software

With the advent of software in the 1950s and 1960s, women began to take on programming roles and made significant contributions to the field. One of the most notable women in this era was Grace Hopper, a mathematician and computer programmer who developed one of the first compilers and was a pioneer in the development of COBOL, a programming language used for business applications.

Women also worked on early computer systems, such as the IBM System/360, and were responsible for writing software for scientific and engineering applications. They also worked on early computer languages like FORTRAN, LISP, and BASIC.

Despite their important contributions, the field of computer programming was still largely male-dominated during this time, and women often faced challenges and discrimination in the workplace.
